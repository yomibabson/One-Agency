== Description ==

This plugin is purely made by developers and for developers. Use this plugin to generate dummy/fake users, posts, custom posts, and woocommerce products for various purposes.

Initially, I was required to test the functionality of my theme in which I need some users, posts, and custom posts. I made this plugin for my purpose. After that, I think there may be some other developers as well who need this kind of plugin with which they can generate some dummy content for posts, custom posts, users, or woocommerce products.
